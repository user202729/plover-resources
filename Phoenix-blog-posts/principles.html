			<p><u>Consonant Sounds</u><br/>
Like every other theory, Phoenix Theory assigns keys to the consonant sounds and consonant blends. Where we vary most from other theories in these simple sounds is in the use of -GS for the final -sh sound (they use -RB which can create conflicts such as cash/carb, bash/barb, etc.).</p>
<p><u>Vowels and Dipthongs</u><br/>
Unlike most conventional theories, Phoenix Theory utilizes phonetics for all vowel sounds with the exception of single-syllable words spelled oo. This creates consistent responses to sounds, rather than having to think about vowel spelling.</p>
<p><u>Stand-alone Medial Unstressed Vowels</u><br/>
All theories save strokes by omitting stand-alone medial unstressed vowels. For example:<br/>
animate is stroked /AN/MAIT, not /AN/I/MAIT;<br/>
nicotine is stroked /NIK/TAOEN, not /NIK/U/TAOEN or /NIK/O/TAOEN;<br/>
mezzanine is stroked /MEZ/NAOEN, not /MEZ/U/NAOEN.</p>
<p><u>Schwa Vowel Sound and Vowel Omission</u><br/>
The defining principle that sets Phoenix Theory apart from other theories is the patented Vowel Omission Principle (VOP) that is applied to the schwa vowel sound, which is the most common vowel sound in the English language. It is an unstressed or neutral vowel &#8212; sometimes called the unvoiced vowel &#8212; that can be represented by any of the letters a, e, i, o, u, y, and by many combinations of letters. Other theories use spelling to represent that sound; Phoenix Theory omits the vowel. Let’s look at the difference:</p>

<p>Omitting the schwa vowel allows phonetic stroking, rather than relying on spelling; eliminates the need to double a consonant that isn’t pronounced as a double (cheddar is not pronounced as ched-dar); creates consistency in writing the sounds, and makes for easy reading of the outlines.</p>
<p>In addition, use of the VOP automatically creates distinctions between words and word parts, eliminating the vast majority of word-boundary conflicts. Using the “other theories” examples above, there could be conflicts such as labor/lay boar, liquor/lick cor-, local/low cal, Cuban/cue ban, cabin/cab bin, bacon/bay con, classical/class cal-, bulletin/bull tin, etc.</p>
<p><u>Inflected Endings</u><br/>
There are two mainstream ways to approach inflected endings:</p>
<ol>
<li>stroke them all separately to totally avoid the possibility of conflict;</li>
<li>incorporate them into every possible word when it doesn’t make a conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each approach has advantages and drawbacks. If you stroke all inflected endings separately, you have an extremely easy learning curve, but you are literally adding hundreds of thousands of strokes to your career.</p>
<p>If you incorporate inflected endings into every possible word that won’t cause a conflict, there is a very large learning curve and mental processing burden, but you will save the maximum number of strokes possible. To incorporate inflected endings onto every possible word without conflict you must be able to recognize word-boundary conflicts, then memorize and develop responses related to which words can be added to without issue, and which cannot. Consistency in application is diminished with this approach. For example: tried, trying, and tries can all be written in one stroke without conflict; pried and pries cannot because they conflict with pride and prize; but prying can be written in one stroke with no problem. This approach to inflected endings can be quite daunting for a student who is first learning theory or beginning speedbuilding.</p>
<p>Phoenix Theory approaches inflected endings with two goals in mind: save strokes when possible while maintaining a simplicity that doesn’t require overthinking, thereby hindering theory assimilation and speedbuilding.</p>
<p>-ing (/-G) and -ed (-D) are added in a separate stroke. However, we avoid adding two strokes for the very common -ings ending by stroking it as /-GZ (buildings = BILD/-GZ). These rules are simple, consistent, and produce no conflicts.</p>
<p>In addition, we are able to incorporate the -G and -D into the outlines for multistroke words where the vowel has been omitted in the previous stroke. For example: season = /SAOEZ/-N, seasoned = /SAOEZ/-ND, seasons = /SAOEZ/-NZ, seasoning = /SAOEZ/-NG.</p>
<p>For plurals, come back for /-Z in a separate stroke for outlines that cannot physically have a final Z incorporated (/PRAIZ/-Z = praises), for words ending in a vowel sound (GAOI/-Z = guys, GAOIZ = guise), and for outlines that end in a -G or -S (/KAUG/-Z = cogs, /KAUGZ = caution). Words ending in final T have the final S added to make a plural. /STAITS = states.</p>
<p>The principles take some practice to incorporate, but when mastered, the student has a system for creating inflected endings that save strokes in many instances, yet is applied consistently across any sounds they hear.</p>
<p>All that said, there is no reason why an inflected ending can’t be tucked into an outline if it doesn’t create a conflict. The writer must be willing to do the research to avoid conflict, and possesses the desire and mental faculty to keep straight what can be incorporated and what cannot. In the theory book we have introduced a very limited number of such outlines on words that are of extreme high frequency.</p>
<p><u>Homophones and Other Sound-alikes</u><br/>
Every theory has to deal with creating unique outlines for homophones and other sound-alike words. Phoenix Theory 2.0 touches on many common homonyms and provides discreet outlines for each. The /R-R stroke for conflict resolution is taught as one of several techniques for differentiating sound-alikes, but is not utilized for common sound-alike words.</p>
<p><u>Briefs and Phrases</u><br/>
Phoenix Theory has always had a wide variety of briefs and phrases available, but limited how many were taught in the First Edition text. Phoenix Theory 2.0 has incorporated many more briefs and phrases for common words and groups of words, but the primary emphasis is still on learning a system whereby you can stroke anything you hear. Theory refinement and the addition of more briefs and phrases is something that continues throughout speedbuilding and right on into your working career. The Speed Plus literary-based speedbuilding books provide material targeted to those goals. New briefs and phrases continue to be developed, both by the authors and by students and teachers. They will be posted to the Phoenix Theory website from time to time.</p>
<p><u>Shortcutting Principles</u><br/>
Phoenix Theory has many optional principles that can save strokes as you write. They are introduced in the theory book and reinforced in Phoenix Theory speedbuilding materials. The Long E ending sound is one example of a stroke-saving shortcutting principle.</p>
<p><u>Long E Ending Sound</u><br/>
Long E is the most common ending sound in the English language. In Phoenix Theory we stroke it as AE.<br/>
hurry = /HUR/AE</p>
<p>We save strokes by adding inflected endings to the AE stroke:<br/>
hurries = /HUR/AEZ<br/>
hurried = /HUR/AED<br/>
hurrying = /HUR/AEG</p>
<p>We also can frequently incorporate the AE into the preceding outline to save a stroke. Earlier you learned about the Vowel Omission Principle (VOP) which results in dropping schwa vowel sounds in medial and ending strokes. Because of that dropped vowel, we have the ability to tuck the ending Long E sound into the preceding stroke. Here are some examples:<br/>
finally = /FAOIN/AEL (/FAOIN/LAE = finely)<br/>
criminally = /KRIM/NAEL (rather than /KRIM/N-L/AE)<br/>
dismally = /DIZ/MAEL (rather than /DIZ/M-L/AE)<br/>
blissfully = /BLIS/FAEL (rather than /BLIS/F-L/AE)<br/>
culturally = /KUL/KHAERL (rather than /KUL/KH-RL/AE)</p>
<p><u>Conclusion</u><br/>
The purpose of a theory book is to introduce the student to foundational principles upon which to build. Innovative application and refining of your theory is never over, even after you graduate from school. As you learn more about your strengths and challenges, you will adapt to what works best for you. In the end, you will write your own unique flavor of whatever theory you learn. Phoenix Theory provides the most phonetically consistent foundation upon which to build.</p>

			<p>some- shortcuts<br>
The word “some” is stroked SM-. Compound words starting with some- can be stroked /SM* + second word. Below are briefs and phrases you can also use. Make dictionary entries as needed.</p>
<p>somebody /SM-B<br>
somebodies /SM-BZ (While this isn’t an “official” word, it is sometimes used in speech…”Well, they just think they’re somebodies, don’t they?”)<br>
somebody’s /SM-BDZ (Redefine the existing entry.)<br>
someday /SDAI (Why not SMAI? Because that is “someway.”)<br>
somehow /SMOU<br>
someone /SM-N or /SWUN<br>
someone else /SM*NLS or /SW*UNLS<br>
someone’s /SM-NS<br>
someplace /SM-P<br>
something /SM-G or /SM-NG<br>
sometime /SMAOIM or /STAOIM<br>
sometimes /SMAOIMZ or /STAOIMZ<br>
someway /SMAI<br>
someways /SMAI/-Z<br>
somewhat /SMAUT or /SWUT or /SWHUT or /SWHAUT (Depends on how you stroke “what.”)<br>
somewhere /SMAIR or /SWHAIR<br>
somewheres /SMAIRZ or /SWHAIRZ<br>
somewise /SWAOIZ or /SM/W-Z or /SMAOIZ (Personally, I’d consider leaving /SMAOIZ available as a brief for “surmise.”)</p>
<p>somebody else /SM-BLS<br>
some of /SM*F<br>
some of the /SM*FT<br>
some other /SM*RGT<br>
some respect /SM*RPT<br>
some should /SM*GS</p>

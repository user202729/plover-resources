			<p>The Vowel-omission Principle (VOP) is what makes Phoenix Theory unique among machine shorthand theories. While it is a new innovation in machine shorthand, its roots have a long history in pen shorthand where “unnecessary” vowels are omitted to reduce the number of movements required to write a word.</p>
<p>We start with defining the principle:</p>
<p><strong>Medial and ending strokes that have final-side consonants: Omit all schwa vowel sounds, which means all “uh” sounds and unaccented or difficult-to-distinguish “eh” and “ih” vowel sounds.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s break that down by first exploring to what strokes this principle applies. Words that are of one stroke do not have medial (middle) or ending strokes, so the VOP does not apply to them. The VOP is utilized in multi-stroke words, and only applies to medial (middle) and ending strokes.</p>
<p>The medial or ending stroke must have a final-side consonant in it. The VOP does not apply to strokes that are a beginning consonant and a vowel.</p>
<p>What is a schwa vowel sound? It is the most common vowel sound in our language! It is an unstressed vowel (is not in an accented syllable), and most closely resembles the sound of a soft short U: uh. The character of the sound is greatly influenced by the letters around it. For example, in the word “metal,” the first syllable is accented, the second is not. The vowel sound in the second syllable is weak, neutral, unstressed, and in fact, almost sounds like it isn’t there because of the final L. That is a vowel that is omitted per the VOP. /MET/-L. When you read a shorthand stroke with an omitted vowel, you can voice a very soft “uh” where the hyphen is to help you pronounce the word. /MET/uhL.</p>
<p>The VOP applies to ALL medial and final strokes with the “uh” sound in them, with the exception of /UG, /UZ, and /UD strokes. Those are conflicts with -G = ing, -Z = s, -D = ed.</p>
<p>So, here’s a recap of where we are so far:<br/>
Must be a middle or ending stroke in a multi-stroke word;<br/>
Must have a final-side consonant in the stroke;<br/>
All “uh” vowel sounds are omitted;<br/>
The only exceptions are /UG, /UZ, and /UD to avoid conflict with inflected endings.</p>
<p>The VOP also applies to unaccented “ih” and “eh” vowel sounds in medial and ending strokes with final-side consonants. For example, the word “panic” is pronounced with an accent on the first syllable: PAN-ik, not pan-IK. An unaccented “ih” is omitted resulting in /PAN/-K as the stroke (voiced as /PAN/uhK). The word “closet” is pronounced with an accent on the first syllable: the vowel in the unaccented syllable is omitted /KLAUZ/-T (voiced as /KLAUZ/uhT).</p>
<p>When reading compressed steno notes, voice a soft “uh” where you see a hyphen:<br/>
/MAOIN/-S = /MAOIN/uhS<br/>
/PAK/-J = /PAK/uhJ<br/>
/MAJ/-K = /MAJ/uhK</p>
<p>If you can understand the word with the vowel omitted, you dropped it in the correct place!</p>
<p>When a medial or ending syllable has an accented Short E or Short I, you will include it in the outline.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
submit &#8211; the accent is on the “mit” syllable, include the vowel and stroke it as /SUB/MIT. Stroking /SUB/M-T (SUB/MuhT) would not create a readable word, would it? The vowel must be included.</p>
<p>cadet &#8211; the accent is on the “det” syllable, include the vowel and stroke it as /KU/DET. Stroking /KU/D-T (KU/DuhT) would not create a readable word; the vowel must be included for it to make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a condensed version of the concepts:</strong><br/>
Must be a middle or ending stroke in a multi-stroke word;<br/>
Must have a final-side consonant in the stroke;<br/>
All “uh” vowel sounds are omitted;<br/>
The only exceptions are /UG, /UZ, and /UD to avoid conflict with inflected endings.<br/>
Unaccented “ih” and “eh” vowels sounds are omitted; accented “ih” and “uh” vowel sounds are written.<br/>
All other vowel sounds (Long Vowels, oh, au, oi) are written in all strokes.</p>

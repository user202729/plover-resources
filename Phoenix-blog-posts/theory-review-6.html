			<p>Consonant-vowel strokes</p>
<p>When writing multistroke words, beginning and medial strokes that consist of an intial consonant and a vowel (no ending consonant) are executed as follows:</p>
<p>Consonant(c)+Long A = (c)A canine /KA/NAOIN<br>
Consonant(c)+Long E = (c)E female /FE/MAIL<br>
Consonant(c)+Long I = (c)I tripod /TRI/PAUD<br>
Consonant(c)+Long O = (c)O prolong /PRO/LAUNG</p>
<p>This helps to avoid conflicts with many stand-alone words and word endings. The principle does not apply to strokes that have an ending consonant, to strokes that consist of a vowel plus an ending consonant, or to ending strokes.</p>
<p>Words starting with the sounds of be- or de- are stroked /B- and /D- respectively.</p>
<p>Here are some more words that utilize this principle:<br>
reply /RE/PLAOI<br>
prepare /PRE/PAIR<br>
halo /HA/LOE<br>
hotel /HO/TEL<br>
bilateral /BI/LAT/R-L<br>
re-create /RE/KRE/AIT<br>
recreation /REK/RE/AIGZ<br>
Seattle /SE/AT/-L<br>
Maria /MU/RE/AU<br>
pizzeria /PAOETS/RE/AU<br>
quesadilla /KAIS/DE/AU<br>
phylum /FI/L-M<br>
Goliath /GO/LI/-GT<br>
begrudge /B-/GR-J<br>
deform /D-/FOERM</p>

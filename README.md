Some resources for stenography theories, other than Plover.

### Stenovations dictionaries

Dictionaries downloaded from [Stenovations](https://www.stenovations.com/support/download/).

The `.dct` files can be extracted by running the `.exe` files, or by using 7z to extract them.

To convert the `.dct` files to `.json` files, use Plover's "Save dictionary as" feature,
and use [this fork of `plover_digitalcat_dictionary` plugin](https://github.com/user202729/plover_digitalcat_dictionary)
to read the `.dct` files.

The most preferred format for Plover is JSON, however it can handle other formats too (with limitation).
To use the dictionaries with other programs, the method above can be used to convert them to other formats
(RTF is supported by default, other formats require installing the corresponding plugin).

Available dictionaries:

* Bryan Theory
* StarTran
* Steno Foundation
* The Steno Way
* Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C)
* Pennsylvania Clinic
* RealWrite
* Robert Walsh Gonzales
* San Antonio Main
* South Coast College
* StenEd
* Stenograph
* Thyra Ellis

... and many more, still not converted from exe to json.

More dictionaries used to be available on the website, but they're deleted now.  
[Internet Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20130414055355/http://www.stenovations.com/support/downloads/)).  
Given that the download page was moved to a new URL, it's likely that the site owner simply forget
to add them while building the new site.

### [Phoenix](https://www.chicorymeadow.com/)

The Phoenix dictionary dictionary used to be available online in Case CATalyst format.
[Web Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20141026014258/http://www.stenographsolutions.com/solution/index.php?View=files)

At the moment, [it's deleted](http://www.stenographsolutions.com/solution/index.php?View=files).

You have to purchase the Phoenix book to get the dictionary.

### [Magnum](https://www.magnumsteno.com/)

The Magnum (StenoMaster/Mark Kislingbury's theory) dictionary used to be available to be downloaded online
([Google Group post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ploversteno/V5tjkNAsW2I)), but it had been taken down by the author.
You have to purchase the book.

The other option would be to use [Stanley's Steno Dictionaries](https://github.com/stanographer/steno-dictionaries/),
a Magnum derivative.

### Theories summary

Most theories only have the dictionary available gratis online, not the theory book/principles.

Only some theories have the list of principles posted online and can be looked for.

To quickly get the feel of the theory, it's possible to look at the word list isn't the steno comparison
chart in the theory comparison PDF file below (for the reasons mentioned in the PDF itself)

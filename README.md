Some resources for stenography theories, other than Plover.

### Stenovations dictionaries

Dictionaries downloaded from [Stenovations](https://www.stenovations.com/support/download/).

The `.dct` files can be extracted by running the `.exe` files, or by using 7z to extract them.

Currently the file `Tri-C Dictionary[Cuyahoga Community College].dct` is not converted to JSON format,
because of a bug in the plugin `plover_digitalcat_dictionary` ([fork](https://github.com/nathyong/plover_digitalcat_dictionary))


### [Phoenix](https://www.chicorymeadow.com/)

The Phoenix dictionary dictionary used to be available online in Case CATalyst format.
[Web Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20141026014258/http://www.stenographsolutions.com/solution/index.php?View=files)

At the moment, [it's deleted](http://www.stenographsolutions.com/solution/index.php?View=files).

You have to purchase the Phoenix book to get the dictionary.

### [Magnum](https://www.magnumsteno.com/)

The Magnum (StenoMaster/Mark Kislingbury's theory) dictionary used to be available to be downloaded online
([Google Group post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ploversteno/V5tjkNAsW2I)), but it had been taken down by the author.
You have to purchase the book.

The other option would be to use [Stanley's Steno Dictionaries](https://github.com/stanographer/steno-dictionaries/),
a Magnum derivative.

### Other dictionaries

### Theories summary

Most theories only have the dictionary available gratis online, not the theory book.
So it would be hard to get a feel of a theory.
Looking at the dictionaries is an option.
